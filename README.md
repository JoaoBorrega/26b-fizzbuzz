# 26b-fizzbuzz

FizzBuzz
The problem
Please write code to accomplish and deliver the requirements from the steps that follow. We're not lookingfor specific applications, programming languages or frameworks to be used. You're free to choose how youdevelop the solution and what tools you use. Do write code that you would be happy delivering to a payingclient.
The test shouldn't be particularly difficult. It is designed to be a straightforward coding exercise, and itshould take you no more than 120 minutes.

Steps

Step 0
Create a git repository on GitHub with public access and the name 26b-fizzbuzz. 
Every one of the nextsteps should be developed in a specific branch namedstep-x, where x is the number of the step.
If you need to change something in a given step, go to that branch and then update the rest.

Step 1
Write a program that produces the following for any contiguous range of integers:
- fizz for numbers that are multiples of 3
- buzz for numbers that are multiples of 5
- fizzbuzz for numbers that are multiples of 15 the number, if none of the above apply.
Being careful to avoid trailing spaces.
e.g. Running the program with a range from 1-20 should produce the following result:
1 2 fizz 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz 13 14 fizzbuzz 16 17 fizz 19 buzz
This code should be in branch step-1.

Step 2
Please enhance your existing solution to perform the following:
Produce a report at the end of the output showing how many times the following were printed:
fizz
buzz
fizzbuzz
an integer
e.g. Running the program with a range from 1-20 should produce the following result:
1 2 fizz 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz 13 14 fizzbuzz 16 17 fizz 19 buzz fizz: 5 buzz: 3 fizzbuzz: 1 integer: 11
(Integer is 11 because there were 11 numbers that were not altered).
This code should be in branch step-2.

Step 3
Finally, please enhance your existing solution with a visual interface that matches the
design specs.
This code should be in branch step-3.
